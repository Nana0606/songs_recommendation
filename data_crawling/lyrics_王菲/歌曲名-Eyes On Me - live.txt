Whenever sang my songs
On the stage on my own
Whenever said my words
Wishing they would be heard
I saw you smiling at me
Was it real or just my fantasy
You'd always be there in the corner
Of this tiny little bar
My last night here for you
same old songs just once more
My last night here with you

Maybe yes maybe no
I kind of liked it your way
How you shyly placed your eyes on me
Oh did you ever know
That I had mine on you
Darling so there you are
With that look on your face
As if you're never hurt
As if you're never down
Shall I be the one for you
Who pinches you softly but sure
If frown is shown then
I will know that you are not dreamer

So let me come to you
Close as I wanted to be
Close enough for me
To feel your heart beating fast
And stay there as I whisper
How I love you peaceful eyes on me
Did you ever know
That I had mine on you
Darling so share with me
Your love if you have enough

Your tests if you're holding back
Or pain if that s what it is
How can I let you know
I'm more than the dress and the voice
Just reach me out then
You will know that you're not dreaming
Darling so there you are
With that look on your face
As if you're never hurt
As if you're never down
Shall I be the one for you
Who pinches you softly but sure
If frown is shown then
I will know that you are not dreamer
