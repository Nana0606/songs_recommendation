We fell in love faster than lightening
Before we got to know
Each other's story
But too much honesty then tore us by the seams
We didn't know how to mend it
So decided to end it

Then one day you called me to tell me
You kinda met a real cool lady
But you're caught in between
You don't know how or why
But you just know you still love me
That you can't forget me
Oh what a sad tragedy

Oh why oh why
Has love become so complicated?
Was it real or was it some twisted dream
And if we could just
Fast rewind and change one scene
Then take us back to the beginning
This time we'll make it for real

Time after time
We would talk it through
The past was too much for you
You took what you could
But now you've lost the courage to start over new
You're not the man I once knew
Things aren't the way they used to

So what now?
What can I do about it
I love you I still do but where do
We go on from here?
It tears me up inside to hear you say you still love me
But you can't be with me
We're stuck in this tragedy

Make It For Real

Make It For Real
For Real
For Real
Make It For Real
For Real

Make It For Real

For Real
