So here's a fact can't hide it no more
I wanna have a Love Story
Like in the movies she'll get what she deserves
A better life,better sex
And she wouldn't know how she'd do without him
He can't believe that he's ready to settle
Like in the movies I wanna get what I deserve

You're perfect angel you're not far from the truth
You read your lines so smoothly
I like your blue eyes
I like the way you move
So take the lead role make me feel so
I would't know how I'd do without you
I can't believe that you're ready to settle
Just like the movies I'm gonna get what I deserve

La la la la.....
I want a love story
La la la la.....
Like in the movies
La la la la.....
I want a love story
Like in the movies
