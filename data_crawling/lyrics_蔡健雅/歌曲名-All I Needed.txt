作曲 : all i needed
All I needed was a little more time
To find a way to, to make it in life
Not that I needed a round of applause
I only hoped that somehow you'd appreciate
Oh I've tried, How I've tried
Tried so hard to make you proud
All I needed was a shoulder to cry on
And someone to, to say it's ok
Not that it was hard to try to be strong
But there were moments when I just had to BREAKDOWN
Oh I've cried, How I've cried
Tears that you will never see ....
Do you know?
How it hurts?
How it feels to be afraid
Of the world?
How it feels to be alone?
Do you know what it means
When you turn and walk away?
Do you know?
That I'll ALWAYS let you down?
Do you know? Do you know? Do you know? Do you know?
All I needed was a little more time..........
Oh I've tried
All the years of silence
Walls between us
And anger inside
You'll misunderstand me
I'll pay you back
In a way that makes you mad
