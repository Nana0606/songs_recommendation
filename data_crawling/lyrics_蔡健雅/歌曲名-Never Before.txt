作曲 : 蔡健雅
I'll never forget
Everything he said
Trust in me I'll be your man
Oh babe you won't regret
And I'll take care of you
I'll buy a big house just for two
You never have to be alone again

That was what he said
To me after we met
Lettin my defenses down
I chose to take a chance
Cos I wanted to believe
I've found someone to be depend
My heart will never be broken again
Till he walked away
So from now on
I'll carry on
Live like we've never
Never loved before
From now on
I'll carry on
Live like we've never met before
Live like we've never met before

Though he didn't stay
His words still remain
To remind I once believe
How good things could've been
But good things never stay
They're just like a one night stand
You wake up in the morning
With a case full of regrets
So from now on
I'll carry on
Live like we've never
Never loved before
From now on
I'll carry on
Live like we've never met before
Live like we've never met before

So from now on
I'll carry on
Live like we've never
Never loved before
From now on
I'll carry on
Live like we've never met before
Live like we've never met before
Live like we've never met before
