Funny day
looking for laughter and finding it there
Sunny day
braiding wild flowers and leaves in my hair
Picked up a pencil and wrote
"I love you" in my finest hand
Wanted to send it
but I don't know where I stand
Telephone
even the sound of your voice is still new
All alone in California and talking to you
And feeling too foolish and strange to
say the words that I had planned
I guess it's too early
cause I don't know where I stand
Crickets call
courting their ladies in star-dappled green
Thickets tall
until the morning comes up like a dream
All muted and misty
so drowsy now I'll take what sleep I can
I know that I miss you
but I don't know where I stand
I know that I miss you
but I don't know where I stand
