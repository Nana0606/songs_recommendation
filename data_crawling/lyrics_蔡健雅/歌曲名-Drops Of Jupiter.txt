Now that she's back in the atmosphere
With drops of jupiter in her hair' hey' hey
She acts like summer and walks like rain
Reminds me that there's time to change' hey' hey
Since the return from her stay on the moon
She listens like spring and she talks like june' hey' hey
Tell me did you sail across the sun
Did you make it to the milky way to see the lights all faded
And that heaven is overrated
Tell me' did you fall for a shooting star
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there
Now that she's back from that soul vacation
Tracing her way through the constellation' hey' hey
She checks out mozart while she does tae-bo
Reminds me that there's room to grow' hey' hey
Now that she's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that she might think of me as plain ol' jane
Told a story about a man who is too afraid to fly so he never did land
Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
And head back to the milky way
And tell me' did venus blow your mind
Was it everything you wanted to find
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there
Can you imagine no love' pride' deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you even when i know you're wrong
Your best friend always sticking up for you even when i know you're wrong
Can you imagine no first dance' freeze dried romance five-hour phone
Conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had . . . and me
Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
And head back toward the milky way
Tell me' did venus blow your mind
Was it everything you wanted to find
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself
