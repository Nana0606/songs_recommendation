Lately I've been feeling kinda far away
Days are nights, how I'm aware
That everything's turning upside down oh
Strangely I have found myself a friend insde
A friend too kind, how I'm aware
That everything's turning inside out
The wall around me keeps on falling
Despite of it all, I don't why
Suddenly it all came to me
That it could've been the fact
I wanna break free
Funny how, I used to be so scared
Oh how I've changed my mind
Now that everything's turning inside out
I'm tired of this city life
Instead of going right I'll take a left this time
Oh I'll even try to beat the lights
