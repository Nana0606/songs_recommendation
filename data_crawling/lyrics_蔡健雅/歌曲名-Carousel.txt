Was it just your fears or
Just a fact that I
Needed you more than you needed me
Now I finally see that
It was not your fault
Just that we've come to the end

Came without a warning
Left without a sound
Came and turned my whole world inside out
Now I finally see that
It was meant to be
Now that we've come to the end

Oh this love
Took a thousand rides
On a big spinning carousel
We took our final ride on the carousel

Gotta keep believing
It was just bad timing
Neither one of us wanted to leave
Though it's hard to see that
We've come to an end
Least I knew that we once loved

Oh this love
Took a thousand rides
On a big spinning carousel
We took our final ride on the carousel

Oh this love
Wasn't made to last so they say
When everything felt right
Still kept falling apart
Despite how hard we tried
