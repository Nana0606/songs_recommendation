Ooh......
Hey there, what is it today
Think I'm gonna forget again
That I couldn't be the one
Wish I had a name and a friend

I'm in pain can't you see it you feel it
Now there's nobody there ooh I tell you
I'm in shame, I'm not worthy I'm bleeding
The flower don't even care
This cipher from nowhere
 
Ooh......
I'm not the one to hold your hand
It must have been a bad day again
For you, who couldn't stand my face?
You wish I could be out of your sight

I can't help it I'm ugly I know it
Now I'm nobody's friend, ooh I tell you
I'm in shame; I'm not worthy of being
My father don't even care
