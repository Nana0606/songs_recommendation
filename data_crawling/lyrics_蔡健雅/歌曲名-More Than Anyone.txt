Is there nothing more to say?
Is there nothing left to do
Sorry's playin like a loop
Tears have fallen to a pool
I have gone down on my knees
I have told you everything
So why can't you believe
When I say
When I say truly I

I love you
More than anyone
I don't say it just for fun
Cos I mean it from my heart
Baby please don't go
Stay a little longer
Till I show how I love you

I know I can be so cruel
And make you feel like a fool
I have hurt you once again
Without knowing what I said
But I know one thing for sure
Is that you complete my world
So please believe me now
When I say
When I say truly I
