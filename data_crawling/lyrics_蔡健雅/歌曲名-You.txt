You

(前身是'靠边停')

She's waiting
He's lying
For the moment of truth he's hiding

So maybe
He told me
I'm not your perfect one
I'm sorry
For really
There is greater a chance we'll grow weary
So goodbye
In my eyes, they cried September rain

Why did the sky above me look so down in sorrow
When they said it was supposed to be blue

I used to
Be wiser
Now the fact that I'm heading

I'm hoping
You'd tell me
You need me by your side

With my heart
Though we're apart
There' a beauty of love inside me
Forever, it'll never leave me till I die

So how am I supposed to live my life
Pretending that there wad nothing about me and you
Yet there is nothing to do
In June I'll think about you
