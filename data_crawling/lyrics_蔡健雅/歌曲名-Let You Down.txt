Midnight is when loneliness creeps within
And I've been wasting my time
Gallivanting around towns all night
Sick and tired of what's there in sight
It's not that, there is anything to deny
It's just that, pretending seems right
Funny how I've kept my smile outside
But this empty yearning deep inside
To everyone I'm no more than prefect
But the fact that there's no harmony
And all these time I' dreading the moment
That I'll finally let you down
Midnight is when loneliness creeps withthin
And I've been wasting my time
Gallivanting around towns all night
Sick and tired of what's there in sight
Not because I'm feeling blue
Fact is I am afraid that
You'd see lies in my eyes
And if one second given the choice to decide
Then I'd rather let me down
To everyone I'm no more than prefect
But the fact is there's no harmony
And all these time I'm dreading the moment
That I'll finally let you down
That I'll finally let you down
