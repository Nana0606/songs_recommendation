I never knew what I had lost
Till you were thousand miles away

I laid out all the memories

Wandering why I let you go away in tears

Wandering why I pushed you away
Tell all the damage had been done

Then knew I d lost the best of me

Cos you loved me the most

Cos you re all the things that I ve been yearning for

Cos you knew me the most

Cos it hurts so bad when you re not around

I close my eyes so I won t see
The fact that you re not coming back
Shattered dreams and broken hearts

Left in pieces for the night to pick them up

Oh then I ll get carried away
Putting them back together

Yet they never looked so incomplete
Cos you loved me the most

Cos you re all the things that I ve been yearning for

Cos you knew me the most

Cos it hurts so bad when you're not aroud

Was love just passing by?

Were we only not meant to be?

When time gets to the truth so sunddenly
I just don t want to believe....

Cos you loved me the most

Cos you re all the things that I ve been yearning for

Cos you knew me the most

Cos it hurts so bad when you're not aroud
