作曲 : 蔡健雅
You're losing your mind
Everything seems to be falling apart
Tears trapped in your eyes
You swallow them down to fill up your heart
But take a look around
You don't have to feel down
Happiness is round the corner
Savor all the sweetness
Lose all your bitterness
Maybe that's the key to happiness
Yeah yeah Shake off some saltiness
Bear with the sourness
That's half of the key to happiness
Key to happiness

You're dying inside
Like a flower that's been kept in the dark
Empty is your soul

Nothing's working to fill it up enough
Though **** ups are abound
There is still hope somehow
So let it surround you baby
Savor all the sweetness
Lose all your bitterness
You'll find that's the key to happiness
Yeah yeah Shake off some saltiness
Bear with the sourness
That's half of the key to happiness
Key to happiness

But don't side step it
There's no detour round it
Bet you've been scratching your head
But why side step it
When there's a road ahead
There's a big sign pointing to it

When you Savor all the sweetness
Lose all your bitterness
You'll find that's the key to happiness
Yeah yeah Shake off some saltiness
Bear with the sourness
That's half of the key to happiness
Key to happiness
Savor all the sweetness
Lose all your bitterness
You'll find that's the key to happiness
Yeah yeah Shake off some saltiness
Bear with the sourness
That's half of the key to happiness
Key to happiness

Key to happiness

Key to happiness
