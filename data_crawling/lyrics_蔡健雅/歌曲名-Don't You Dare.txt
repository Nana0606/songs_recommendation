Far far away I've travelled
Just to get to the other side
Then you come along and haunt me
(Don't you dare) don't you dare get too close
Long long time ago you made it
Seem like we were impossible
So I wrote you off (bad history)
(Don't you dare) don't you dare get too close
* Now that I'm way ahead from where I've left behind
Who are you then to call me and ask if I'm alright?
Now that I'm bright and beautiful you're fat and old
To think I've shed my pride for you down on my knees
Tried hard to convince myself (it's not me)
Who's not good enough for you
Bring bring me a javelin quick !
(Don't you dare) don't you dare get too close
(repeat *)
Vanish now before I cry
Diminish or else I might
How how very unneccessary
To see you walking down my hall
I was hit by the shame in me
(Don't you dare) don't you dare get too close
