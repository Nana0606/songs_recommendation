Wise men say

Only fools rush in

But I can't help

Falling in love with you

Shall I stay

Would it be a sin

If I can't help

Falling in love with you

Like a river flows

Surely to the sea

Darling so it goes
Some things are meant to be

Take my hand

Take my whole life too

For I can't help

Falling in love with you

Like a river flows
Surely to the sea

Darling so it goes
Some things are meant to be

Take my hand

Take my whole life too

For I can't help

Falling in love with you

For I can't help

Falling in love with you
