It's all
You're my sunshine after the rain
你是藏在我嘴里的甜味

没有谁能分享
我也无所谓
It's all
It's all Because of you

You're my sunshine

oh yeah
不怪谁
别人不了解
想念的滋味
超过了一切
我相信只要专心你就能感觉
How much I feel for you

我也不问谁后来的情节
你不知道你遇上的人多珍贵

And if only you were here

I'll tellyou
yes I'll tell you oh yeah
You're my sunshine after the rain

你是藏在我嘴里的甜味

没有谁能分享
我也无所谓
It's all
It's all Because of you

Because of you

我还以为 是个幻觉
认识第一天
就变成永远
初恋像一个秋千
回荡心里面
I miss you
yes I miss you
You're my sunshine after the rain

你是藏在我嘴里的甜味

没有谁能分享
我也无所谓
It's all
It's all Because of you

已经想过好多遍
快停下来
对你的想念

你却像一首歌

挂在嘴边

You're my sunshine after the rain

Because of you

It's all
Because of you

你是藏在我嘴里的甜味

没有谁能分享
我也无所谓
It's all

It's all Because of you

没有谁能分享
我也无所谓
It's all

It's all Because of you

没有谁能分享
我也无所谓
It's all

It's all Because of you

You're my sunshine after the rain
