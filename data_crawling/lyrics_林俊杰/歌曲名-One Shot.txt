 Just one shot
 Is all you got to make or break into your fame
 Just one shot
 They will lift you up and take you down the same
 Only got one shot
 Will you give it all you've got
 Let it take you to the top
 Or will you bleed it out in vain?
 Only got one shot
 Tell your heart to never stop
 Lock your eyes only on the spot
 If there is no pain there will be no gain
 O Father please, I ask for Your mercy
 They judge me way before they even know me
 O Father please, do you hear me screaming
 These lights won't stop chasing after me
 I will not fall I will not crawl, I will keep on standing tall
 Til I'm strong enough to break this wall
 Oh~ I won't drown don't tie me down
 Won't you just set me free
 It takes one shot to strip it away from me
 And O my Lord, I can’t believe what I saw
 You got one shot
 Just to make or break your fame
 Just one shot
 They will lift you up, take you down the same
 Only got one shot
 Will you give it all youve got
 Let it take you to the top
 Or will you bleed it out in vain?
 Only got one shot
 Tell your heart to never stop
 Lock your eyes only on the spot
 If there is no pain there will be no gain
 Our father, who art in heaven
 Hallowed be thy name
 In thy name I pray to you, oh forever it remains
 I know you haven't left me but I'm feeling so alone
 When the darkness comes I shall never have to wait on my own
 I feel so lost, my mind is going out of control
 Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says The Lord
 I'm persecuted but not forsaken, struck down to the floor
 But not destroyed cause Its not like this hasn't happened before
 I see these lights and you've warned me to be on the alert
 My heart is tired from soaking it up like rain in the dirt
 Oh~ just one shot
 Oh~ yeah~
 Yeah~ one shot
 They will lift you up, take you down the same
 Only got one shot
 Will you give it all you've got
 Let it take you to the top
 Or will you bleed it out in vain?
 Only got one shot
 Tell your heart to never stop
 Lock your eyes only on the spot
 If there is no pain there will be no gain
