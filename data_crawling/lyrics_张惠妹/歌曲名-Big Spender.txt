The minute you walked in the joint
I could see you were a man of distinction
A real big spender
Good lookin' so refined
Say wouldn't you like to know
What's goin on in my mind
So let me get to the point
I don't pop my cork for every guy I see
Hey big spender
Spend a little time with me
Wouldn't you like to have fun fun fun
How's about a few laughs laughs laughs
I can show you a good time
Let me show you a good time
The minute you walked in the joint
I could see you were a man of distinction
A real big spender
Good lookin' so refined
Say wouldn't you like to know
What's goin on in my mind
So let me get to the point
I don't pop my cork for every guy I see
Hey big spender
Hey big spender
Hey big spender
Spend a little time with me
Wouldn't you like to have fun fun fun
How's about a few laughs laughs laughs
I can show you a good time
Let me show you a good time
The minute you walked in the joint
I could see you were a man of distinction
A real big spender
Good lookin' so refined
Say wouldn't you like to know
What's goin on in my mind
So let me get to the point
I don't pop my cork for every guy I see
Hey big spender
Hey big spender
Hey big spender
Spend a little time with me
