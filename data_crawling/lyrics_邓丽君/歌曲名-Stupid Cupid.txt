Stupid Cupid You're a real mean guy
I'd like to clip your wings So you can't fly
I am in love and it's a crying shame
And I know that you're the one to blame
Hey hey Set me free
Stupid Cupid Stop picking on me
I can't do my homework And I can't think straight
I meet him every morning At 'bout half-past eight
I'm acting like a lovesick fool
You've even got me carrying his books to school
Hey hey Set me free
Stupid Cupid Stop picking on me
You mixed me up for good Right from the very start
Hey, go play Robin Hood With somebody else's heart
You got me jumping like a crazy clown
And I don't feature what your puttin' down
Well since I kissed his loving lips of wine
The thing that bothers me is That I like it fine
Hey heySet me free
Stupid CupidStop picking on me
