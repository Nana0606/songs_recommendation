Her name was Lola
 She was a showgirl
 With yellow feathers in her hair
 And a dress cut down to there
 She would marengue
 And do the cha-cha
 And while she tried to be a star
 
 Tony always tended bar
 Across the crowded floor
 They worked from eight to four
 They were young and they had each other
 Who could ask for more
 At the copa-copacabana
 The hottest spot north of havana
 At the copa-copacabana
 Music and passion were always the fashion
 At the copa they fellin' love
 
 
 His name was Rico
 He wore a diamond
 He was escorted to his chair
 He saw Lola dancin' there
 And when she finished
 He called her over
 But Rico went a bit too far
 Tony sailed across the bar
 
 And then the punches flew
 And chairs were smashed in two
 There was blood and a single gunshot
 But just who shot who
 At the copa-copacabana
 The hottest spot north of havana
 At the copa-copacabana
 Music and passion were always the fashion
 At the copa
 She lost her love
 
 Her name is Lola
 She was a showgirl
 But that was thirty years ago
 When they used to have a show
 Now it's a disco
 But not for Lola
 Still in the dress she used to wear
 Faded feathers in her hair
 She sits there so refined
 And drinks herself half blind
 She lost her youth and her tony
 
 
 Now she's lost her mind
 At the copa-copacabana
 The hottest spot north of havana
 At the copa-copacabana
 Music and passion were always the fashion
 At the copa don't fall in love
 Don't fall in love
