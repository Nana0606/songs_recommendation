I bless the day I found you
 I want my arms around you
 And so I beg you:
 Let it be me.

 Don't take this heaven from one
 If you must cling someone
 Now and forever,
 let it be me.

 Each time we meet, love
 I find complete love
 Without your sweet love,
 what would life be?

 So never leave me lonely
 Tell me that you love me only
 And say you'll always
 let it be me.

 let it be me.
