Hey lady,
you lady, cursing at your life
You''re a discontented mother
and a regimented wife
I''ve no doubt you dream about
-the things you''ll never do
But I wish someone had talked to me like I
-wanna talk to you
Oh, I''ve been to Georgia and California
- and anywhere I could run
I took the hand of a preacher man
-and we made love in the sun
But I ran out of places
and friendly faces because I had to be free
I''ve been to paradise
but I''ve never been to me
Please lady, please lady,
-don''t just walk away
''Cause I have this need to tell you
why I''m all alone today
I can see so much of me
-still living in your eyes
Won''t you share a part of a weary heart
-that has lived a million lies....
Oh, I''ve been to Niece
-and the Isle of Greece
while I''ve sipped champagne on a yacht
I''ve moved like Harlow in Monte Carlo
-and showed ''em what I''ve got
I''ve been undressed by kings
and I''ve seen some things
-that a woman ain''t supposed to see
I''ve been to paradise,
but I''ve never been to me
Hey, you know what paradise is? It''s a lie
A fantasy we create about people and places as we''d like them to be
But you know what truth is?
It''s that little baby you''re holding
It''s that man you fought with this morning
The same one you''re going to make love with tonight
That''s truth, that''s love
Sometimes I''ve been to crying for unborn children
-hat might have made me complete
But I took the sweet life,
-I never knew I''d be bitter from the sweet
I''ve spent my life exploring the subtle
whoring that costs too much to be free
Hey lady, I''ve been to paradise,
but I''ve never been to me
I''ve been to paradise
I''ve never been to me
