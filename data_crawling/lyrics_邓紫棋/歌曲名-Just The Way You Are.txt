Oh his eyes, his eyes
Make the stars look like they're not shining
His hair, his hair
Falls perfectly without he trying
He's so wonderful
And I tell him every day
Yeah I know I know
When I compliment him he won't believe me
And its so, its so
Sad to think he don't see what I see
But every time he asks me do I look okay
I say
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are

And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are

Her lips, her lips
I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh
She hates but I think it’s so sexy
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day

Oh you know, you know you know I'd never ask you to change
If perfect is what you're looking for Then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking If you look okay
(ok)You know I say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are

And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are

The way you are
The way you are
Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are

And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
