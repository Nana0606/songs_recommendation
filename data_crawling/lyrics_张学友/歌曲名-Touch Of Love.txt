Touch Of Love
This the season now
For gifts and giving all
The love our hearts
And dreams can afford
And when I think about you
The hope that you've handed out
I want to give back all I have
And then some more
But I 'm only human
I can only do so much
But all the miracles we need Is
just one touch
From me from you
Helping someone who can't make it on their own
No one wants to be alone at a time like this
Only joy should exist
When the world gets too much
All we need
All we need is a touch of love
Is A touch of love

When hard times appear
When we drown in our tears
There's faith enough to see us through
Whatever rains on us
We can always trust
That heaven's hand will guide us through
Yeah we're only human
But we can all do so much
All the miracles we need Is just one touch
Yeah just one touch (Chorus)
It took a child touch the world
Just think what we can do
Think of the miracles
