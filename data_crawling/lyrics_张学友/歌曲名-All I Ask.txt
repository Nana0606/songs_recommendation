All I Ask

I'm not asking you to change
Who you are
where you're going
I'm not asking you to lose control
I'm not asking for the world
Or you to keep it spinning
Just that you'll be the one receiving
All this lovin' that I'm giving
All I ask is that you love me
In my own special way
Yet that I'm the one who holds you
Where there's nothing left to say
All I ask is that you need me
More than anybody else
That you're there for me to turn to
When I'm lost myself
All I ask of you
all I ask of you Is that you love me

When I think of all the things
We will do when we're together
Say a little prayer for love
I won't take up all your time
Just give me all your precious moments
Baby open your arms
Let me fill them with emotion
All I ask is that you love me In my own special way
Yet that I'm the one who holds you
Where there's nothing left to say
All I ask is that you need me
More than anybody else
That you're there for me to turn to
When I'm lost myself
All I ask of you
all I ask of you Is that you love me
That you love me I believe
I believe  I believe
You were meant for me
Let you be  let you breathe
let you fly 'Cos you come right back to me
You come right back to me baby
All I ask is that you love me
In my own special way
Yet that I'm the one who holds you
Where there's nothing left to say
All I ask is that you need me
More than anybody else
That you're there for me to turn to
When I'm lost myself
All I ask of you
all I ask of you Is that you love me
That you love me
Tell me do you love me
Do you love me
