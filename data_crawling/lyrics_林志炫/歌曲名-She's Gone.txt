She's gone
Out of my life
I was wrong
I'm to blame
I was so untrue
I can't live without her love
In my life
there's just an empty space
All my dreams are lost
I'm wasting away
Forgive me girl
Lady won't you save me lady,
My heart belongs to you
Lady can you forgive me lady，
For all I've done to you
Lady, oh Lady lady,oh，lady
She's gone
Out of my life
Oh she's gone
I find it so hard to go on
I really miss that girl, my love
Come back Into my arms
Come back Into my arms
I'm so alone
I'm begging you
I'm down on my knees
Forgive me girl
Lady won't you save me lady,
My heart belongs to you
Lady can you forgive me lady，
For all I've done to you
Lady, oh Lady lady,oh，lady
oh Lady oh，lady
oh~ oh····
oh~ oh····
Lady won't you save me lady,
My heart belongs to you
Lady can you forgive me lady，
For all I've done to you
Lady~oh~Lady lady,oh，lady
My heart belongs to you
Lady can you forgive me lady，
For all I've done to you
