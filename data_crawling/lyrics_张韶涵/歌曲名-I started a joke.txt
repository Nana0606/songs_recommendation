I started a joke
which started the whole world crying
But I didn't see
that the joke was on me oh no
I started to cry
which started the whole world laughing
Oh if I'd only seen
that the joke was on me
I looked at the skies
running my hands over my eyes
And I fell out of bed
hurting my head from things that I'd said
Til I finally died
which started the whole world living
Oh if I'd only seen
that the joke was on me
I looked at the skies
running my hands over my eyes
And I fell out of bed
hurting my head from things that I'd said
Til I finally died
which started the whole world living
Oh if I'd only seen
that the joke was one me
Oh no that the joke was one me
