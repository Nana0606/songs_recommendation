作曲 : George Harrison
 作词 : George Harrison
I look, at you all, see the love, there that's sleeping
While my guitar, gently weeps
I look, at the floor, and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar, gently weeps
I don't know why, nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how, someone controlled you
They bought and sold you
I look, at the world, and I notice it's turning
While my guitar, gently weeps
With every mistake, we must surely, be learning
Still my guitar, gently weeps
I don't know how, you were diverted
You were perverted, too
I don't know how, you were inverted
No one alerted you
I look, at you all, see the love
There that's sleeping
While my guitar, gently weeps
Look at you all...
Still my guitar, gently weeps
