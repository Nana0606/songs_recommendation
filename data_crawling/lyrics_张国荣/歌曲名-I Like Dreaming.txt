I like dreamin'
Cause dreamin' can make you mine
I like dreamin'
close my eyes and feelin' fine
When the lights go down
I'm holding you so tight
Gotcha in my arms and it's paradise
Till the morning light
I see us on the shore
beneath the bright sunshine
We've walked along
St.Thmoas Beach a million times
Hand in hand
two lovers kissin' in the sand
Side by side
the tide rolls in
I'm touching you, you touching me
If only it could be
I like dreamin'
Cause dreamin' can make you mine
I like dreamin'
close my eyes and feelin' fine
When the lights go down
I'm holding you so tight
Gotcha in my arms and it's paradise
Till the morning light
Through each dream how our love has grown
I see us with our children and our happy home
Little smile so warm and terder lookin' up at us
Bless by love
the world we share until I wake
I reach for you
and you're just not there
I like dreamin'
cause dreamin' can make you mine
I like holdin' you close touchin' your skin
Even if it's in my mind
I like dreamin'
cause dreamin' can make you mine
I like dreamin'
close my eyes and feelin' fine
I like dreamin'
Cause dreamin' can make you mine
I like dreamin'
close my eyes and feelin' fine
I like dreamin'
Cause dreamin' can make you mine
I like dreamin'
close my eyes and feelin' fine
I like dreamin'
cause dreamin' can make you mine
