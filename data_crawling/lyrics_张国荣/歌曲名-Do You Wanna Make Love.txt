Sometimes the love thythms that fill the afternoon
Loose all their meaning with the rising moon
Hold me and tell me that the words you say are true
Answer the question I must ask of you
Do you wanna make love
Or do you just wanna fool around
I guarantee it will bring you down
If you try and fool yourself
Do you wanna make love
Or do you just wanna fool around
You can take it seriously
Or take it somewhere else
Take all the freedom that a lover will allow
If you feel the feeling that I'm feeling now
Where love goes a fool knows
That the hurt can go as deep
Don't make a promise that you cannot keep
Do you wanna make love
Or do you just wanna fool around
I guarantee it will bring you down
If you try and fool yourself
Do you wanna make love
Or do you just wanna fool around
You can take it seriously
Or take it somewhere else
And if you wanna get close to me
You can do it so easily
Well is it love that I see when I look in your eyes
Or just another empty lie
Do you wanna make love
Or do you just wanna fool around
I guarantee it will bring you down
If you try and fool yourself
Do you wanna make love
Or do you just wanna fool around
You can take it seriously
Or take it somewhere else
Do you wanna make love
Or do you just wanna fool around
I guarantee it will bring you down
If you try and fool yourself
Do you wanna make love
Or do you just wanna fool around
You can take it seriously
Or take it somewhere else
