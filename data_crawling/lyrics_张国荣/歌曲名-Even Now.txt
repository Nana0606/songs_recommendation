Even now when there's someone else who cares
When there's someone home who's waiting just for me
Even now I think about you as I'm climbin' up the stairs
And I wonder what to do so she won't see
That even now when I know it wasn't right
And I've found a better life than what we had
Even now I wake up cryin' in the middle of the night
And I can't believe it still could hurt so bad
Even now when I have come so far
I wonder where you are, I wonder why it's still so hard without you
Even now when I come shining through, I swear I think of you
And how I wish you knew, even now

Even now when I never hear your name
And the world has changed so much since you've been gone
Even now I still remember and the feeling's still the same
And this pain inside of me goes on and on, even now
Even now when I have come so far
I wonder where you are
I wonder why it's still so hard without you
Even now when I come shinin' through
I swear I think of you
And how I wish you knew
Somehow
Even now
