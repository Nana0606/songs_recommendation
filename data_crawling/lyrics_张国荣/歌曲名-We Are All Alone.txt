Outside the rain begins, and it may never end
So cry no more, on the shore a dream
Will take us out to sea
Forever more, forever more
Close your eyes and dream, and you can be with me
Neath the waves, through the caves of hours
Long forgotten now
We're all alone, We're all alone
Close the window calm the light
And it will be alright
No need to bother now
Let it out, let it all begin
Learn how to pretend
Once a story's told it can't help but grow old
Roses do, lovers too, so cast your seasons to the wind
And told me dear, Ohhh hold me Dear
Close the window calm the light
And if you will be all alright
No need to bother now
Let it out, let it all begin
All's forgotten now
We're all alone, all alone
Close the window calm the light
And if you will be all alright
No need to bother now
Let it out, let it all begin
Owe it to the wind
My love
Hold me Dear
All's forgotten now my love
We're all alone
