《DAY DREAMIN'》


I wake up with the sun in the morning.
And once again
I find you're with me and I know
you're the only one who can help to make it easy.
So here we are,
you and I,
good morning sorrow.

Just like before I lean on you.
You're the one friend who's true.
Who needs answers when there's nothing left to say.
Why should I hear it all again.
How times easies pain.
When nothing can bring back yesterday.

I wake up with the sun in the morning.
Leave the phone off the hook so I'm busy all day long.
The coffee's growing cold
my books lie unopened.
Here we are
once again
good morning sorrow.

Just like before I lean on you.
My friend you never knew.
What if feels like to be in love this way.
Maybe the years will heal the pain.
Maybe I'll even love again.
But nothing can bring back yesterday
Just like before I lean on you.
My friend you never knew.
What if feels like to be in love this way.
Maybe the years will heal the pain.
Maybe I'll even love again.
But nothing can bring back yesterday

Nothing can vring back yesterday
