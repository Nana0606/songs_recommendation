I walk along the street of sorrow
The boulevard of broken dreams
Where gigolo and gigolette
Can take a kiss without regret
So they forget their broken dreams
You laugh tonight and cry tomorrow
When you'll be hold your shattered schemes
And gigolo and gigolette
Wake up to find their eyes are wet
With tears that tell of broken dreams
Here is where you'll always find me
Always walking up and down
But I left my soul behind me
In an old cathedral town
The joy that you find here you borrow
You cannot keep it long it seems
But gigolo and gigolette
Still sing a song and dance along
The boulevard of broken dreams
<music>
The joy that you find here you borrow
You cannot keep it long it seems
But gigolo and gigolettes
Still sing a song and dance along
The boulevard of broken dreams
