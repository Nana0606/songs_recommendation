There's a peaceful easy feeling
Blowing softly thru the trees
Which welcomes in the morning light
That shines for me to see
And it takes me past my sorrow
And keeps me from the rain
For all these things I'd like to Thank you once again
There's a stairway in the mountains
And it leads up to the stars
And stars can move the clouds away
And keep me from the dark
And when I feel alone and lost
They'll show me the way
For all these things I'd like to thank you once again
Thank you for the love
That's right here in this song
Thank you for my dreams
For everything Life has given me
We seldom stop to think that
We have travelled very far
Seen and heard a million things Even wished upon a star
Cared for all the close friends
Who have passed along the way
For all these things and more Thank you once again
Thank you for the love
That's right here in this song
Thank you for my dreams
For everything Life has given me
Thank you for the love
That's right here in this song
Thank you for my dreams
For everything Life has given me
Thank you for the love
That's right here in this song
Thank you for my dreams
For everything Life has given me
Thank you for the love
That's right here in this song
Thank you for my dreams
For everything Life has given me
