And I love you so
And I love you so.
The people ask me how.
How I've lived till now.
 I tell them I don't know.
I guess they understand.
 How lonely life has been.
But life began again.
The day you took my hand.
And yes I know.
 How lonely（loveless）life can be.
The shadows follow me.
 And the night won't set me free.
But I don't let the evening.
Get（Bring）me down.
 Now that you're around~ me.
And you love me too.
 Your thoughts are just for me.
You set my spirit free. I'm happy that you do.
The book of life is brief. And once a page is read.
All but love is dead that is my belief.
And I love you so. The people ask me how.
How i've lived till now. I tell them I don't know.
