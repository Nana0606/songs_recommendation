I know your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I wanna feel you in my arms again
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm your in love
then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love
deep is your love
How deep is your love
I really need to learn
'cause we're living in a world of fools
Breakin us down
when they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
I believe in you
You know the door to my very soul
You're the light in my deepest darkest hour
You're my savior when I fall
And you may not think that I care for you
When you know down inside that I really do
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love
I know your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I wanna feel you in my arms again
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love
then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love
How deep is your love
How deep is your love
I believe in you
I believe in you
I believe in you
