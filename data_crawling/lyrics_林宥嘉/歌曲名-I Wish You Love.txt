I wish you bluebirds in the spring
to give your heart a song to sing
And then a kiss but more than this
I wish you love
And in July a lemonade
to cool you in some leafy glade
I wish you health and more than wealth
I wish you love
My breaking heart and I agree
that you and I could never be
So with my best my very best
I set you free
I wish you shelter from the storm
A cozy fire to keep you warm
But most of all
when snowflakes fall
I wish you love
My breaking heart and I agree
that you and I could never be
So with my best, my very best,
I set you free
I wish you shelter from the storm
A cozy fire to keep you warm
But most of all
when snowflakes fall
I wish you love
