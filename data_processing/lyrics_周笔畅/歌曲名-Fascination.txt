词：Daniel Klein/Charli Taft
I got my sights on you
Checking you out from my point of view
Just to be crystal clear to let you know
I play to win
Don't wanna wait let's jump right in
It would be like finding a snowflake in June
For me to find someone cooler than you
Since we're in the right place the right time
Why pretend you don't
Want me like I want you
Call it right
Call it wrong
Call me when you want
Baby you're the one
You're my fascination
Touch me there
If you dare
Hit me with your charm
Baby you're the one
You're my fascination
Whoa I wanna give you all my love
Whoa I wanna give you all my love
Whoa I wanna give you all my love
Baby you're the one
You're my fascination
I'm all systems go
You're overriding me with your control
It's such a mystery how you take me there
You shut it down
Sending me right up in the air
It would be like finding a snowflake in June
For me to find someone cooler than you
You take my breath away
I don't know what to say
Don't you want me like I want you
Call it right
Call it wrong
Call me when you want
Baby you're the one
You're my fascination
Touch me there
If you dare
Hit me with your charm
Baby you're the one
You're my fascination
Whoa I wanna give you all my love
Whoa I wanna give you all my love
Whoa I wanna give you all my love
Baby you're the one
You're my fascination
If you wanna take it to the next level
Baby say the word and I'll be your girl
Tell me are you gonna catch me if I fall
Call it right
Call it wrong
Call me when you want
Baby you're the one
You're my fascination
Touch me there
If you dare
Hit me with your charm
Baby you're the one
You're my fascination
Whoa I wanna give you all my love
Whoa I wanna give you all my love
Whoa I wanna give you all my love
Baby you're the one
You're my fascination
