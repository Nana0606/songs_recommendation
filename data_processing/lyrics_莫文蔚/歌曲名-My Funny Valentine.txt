My Funny Valentine
莫文蔚
Be hold the way our fine feathered friend
His virtue doth parade
Thou knowest not my dim witted friend
The picture Thou hast made
Thy vacant brow and Thy tousled hair
Conceal Thy good intent
Thou noble upright, truthful, sincere
And slightly dopey gent
You're my funny Valentine
Sweet comic Valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable
Unphotographable
Yet you're my favorite work of art
Is your figure less than Greek
Is your mouth a little weak
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?
But don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay little Valentine stay
Each day is Valentine's day!
Is your figure less than Greek
Is your mouth a little weak
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?
But don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay little Valentine stay
Each day is Valentine's day!
