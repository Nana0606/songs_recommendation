Each time you failed
you just called me your girl
你以为这是爱情起死回生的药
You know
你什么都很潮 但这种调调
Woah Woah
你耍的绝招其实很搞笑
听过了九百次的梗
已变成骚扰
And you know what
我亲爱的 你大事不妙
Woah Woah
Mirror mirror on the wall
I don't need you any more
I'm the smartest of them all
G R L S My girl
You cast a spell
You made me melt
I'm back from hell
I'm not your girl
Hey I wanna rule my world
I don't wanna be your girl
And I just wanna be myself
I'm not your girl
I'm not your girl
(My Girl)
Na Na Na
(All of my girls WHAT)
Na Na Na
(All of my girls WHAT)
刮风打雷没有谁
Girls like us we ain't afraid
如果爱谁 命就给谁
看起来 很凄美
想起来 太谦卑
Mirror mirror on the wall
I don't need you any more
I know I'm the smartest of them all
Mirror mirror on the wall
Boys are stupid Let them fall
We'll still shine like disco ball
You cast a spell
You made me melt
I'm back from hell
I'm not your girl
Hey I wanna rule my world
I don't wanna be your girl
And I just wanna be myself
I'm not your girl
I'm not your girl
(My Girl)
Na Na Na
(All of my girls WHAT)
Na Na Na
(All of my girls WHAT)
I am my own girl
Hey I wanna rule my world
I don't wanna be your girl
And I just wanna be myself
I'm not your girl
I'm not your girl
(My Girl)
Na Na Na
(All of my girls WHAT)
Na Na Na
I am my own girl
