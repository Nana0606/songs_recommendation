Heaven Help My Heart
 邓丽君 演唱
 If it were love I would give that
 love every second I had
 And I do
 Did I know where he'd lead me to?
 Did I plan
 Doing all of this
 for the love of a man?
 But I let it happen anyhow
 And what I'm feeling now
 Has no easy explanation
 Reason plays no part
 Heaven help my heart
 I love him too much
 What if he saw my whole exstence
 Turning around a word,
 a smile , a touch?
 One of these days,
 and it won't be long
 He'll know more about me
 Then he should
 All my dreams will be understood
 No surprise
 Nothing more to learn from
 the look in my eyes
 Don't you know that
 time is not my friend
 I'll fight it to the end
 Hoping to keep that best of moments
 When the passions come
 Heaven help my heart
 The day that I find
 Suddenly I've run out of secrets
 Suddenly I'm not always on his mind
 Maybe it's best to love a stranger
 That's what I've done heaven help my heart
 Heaven help my heart
